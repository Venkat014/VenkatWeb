<h2>Rohit Sharma</h2>
<p><b>Rohit Gurunath Sharma</b> (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,<sup>[3]</sup> Sharma is known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which famously includes most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.<sup>[4]</sup> He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.</p>
<p><b>Sharma</b> formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2022.</p>
<p><b>Sharma</b> currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.</p>
<p>Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.</p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p><b>Sharma</b> was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.<sup>[5]</sup> His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.<sup>[6]</sup> His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.<sup>[7]</sup> He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.<sup>[8]</sup> His mother tongue is Telugu.</p>
<p><b>Sharma</b> joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".<sup>[8]</sup> Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.<sup>[9]</sup></p>
<h2>Pesonal Life</h2>
<p>Sharma married his longtime girlfriend, Ritika Sajdeh on 13 December 2015. <br>They have one child, a girl born in 2018.<sup>[10]</sup> She is a practitioner of the 
<br>meditation technique Sahaj Marg.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
<p>He practices an eggetarian diet.<sup>[12]</sup></p>
<h2>Commercial endorsements</h2>
<p>Sharma has been sponsored by several brands including CEAT and the Swiss watchmaker Hublot.<sup>[13][14]</sup> In his career, Sharma has endorsed many other brands including Maggi, Fair and Lovely, Lay's, Nissan, energy drink Relentless, Nasivion nasal spray, Aristocrat by VIP Industries, Adidas and Oppo mobiles.<sup>[15]</sup></p>
<h2>Youth and domestic first-class career
</h2>
<p>Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.<sup>[16]</sup> It was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight.<sup>[17]</sup> He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probable's list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.<sup>[18]</sup></p>
<p>Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and 22 as India won by 3 wickets.<sup>[19]</sup> He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat.<sup>[20]</sup> Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57) in his second innings in the final against Bengal.<sup>[21]</sup></p>
<p>Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his highest career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.<sup>[22]</sup> In October 2013, upon the retirement of Ajit Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.<sup>[23]</sup></p>
